Data Preprocessing and Normalization for Habr Popularity Datasets
Description
This laptop performs basic data cleaning and preprocessing using the example of the "Habr Popularity" dataset. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis and model building, which includes the following steps:

Data import: loading and initial examination of the data set structure, determining data types and checking for missing values.
Omission processing: Replacing or deleting missing values for correct feature processing.
Normalization of the content_len trait: Using the RobustScaler method from the sklearn library to scale the content_len trait, which helps to smooth out the impact of outliers and prepare data for visualization and models.
Visualization of the distribution: plotting using seaborn to visualize the distribution of content_len values after normalization.
Libraries used
Pandas for working with tabular data and processing missing values.
Sklearn for data normalization.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization of distributions and data analysis.
